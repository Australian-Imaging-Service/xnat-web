<h3>Use the new XNAT Desktop Client for Uploads and Downloads</h3>
<p style="width: 500px">
    The new <a href="https://download.xnat.org/desktop-client/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold">XNAT Desktop Client</a>,
    released in 2018, has been developed to handle uploads and downloads of XNAT image data. Install the Desktop Client on your Mac,
    PC, or Linux system. Store connections to multiple XNATs. Apply DICOM Edit and anonymization scripts to your uploaded data
    before it leaves your desktop.
</p>
<p style="width: 500px">
    The <a href="https://download.xnat.org/desktop-client/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold">XNAT Desktop Client</a> also
    installs system support for the 'xnat://' protocol, which is used to download XNAT image data from an XML manifest. The Desktop Client
    handles large downloads with ease, and allows you to manage all data transfers &mdash; giving you the ability to pause, resume, or
    cancel any ongoing transfer.

<h3>Download the XNAT Upload Assistant</h3>
<p style="width: 500px">
    You can upload DICOM and ECAT files using the <a href="https://download.xnat.org/upload-assistant/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold">XNAT Upload Assistant</a>.
    This tool is installed on your local machine and provides the ability to access
    multiple XNAT servers from a single tool, as well as apply DICOM edit and anonymization scripts to the data before it
    leaves your desktop, reducing the risk of exposing PHI or sensitive patient data during the transfer process.
