# XNAT Web Application #

This is the XNAT Web application build.

### Building ###

You can build with a simple Gradle command:

```bash
gradle clean war
```

You may need to build the [XNAT Gradle plugin](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/gradle-xnat-plugin) first, although it should be available on the XNAT Maven repository.
